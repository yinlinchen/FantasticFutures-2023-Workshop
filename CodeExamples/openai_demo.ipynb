It covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, holding an abundance of life and secrets beneath its depths. Let me take you on a journey to explore the wonders of the ocean.\n","\n","The ocean is a vast body of saltwater that stretches across the globe, connecting continents and shaping the climate. It is home to a diverse array of ecosystems, from coral reefs teeming with colorful fish to deep-sea trenches housing bizarre and fascinating creatures.\n","\n","One of the most remarkable features of the ocean is its sheer size. It is divided into five major basins: the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern, and Arctic Oceans. These vast expanses of water are interconnected, allowing for the movement of currents and the exchange of heat and nutrients.\n","\n","The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. It absorbs and stores vast amounts of heat from the sun, distributing it around the planet through ocean currents. These currents also transport nutrients, influencing weather patterns and supporting marine life.\n","\n","Speaking of marine life, the ocean is home to an incredible diversity of species. From the smallest plankton to the largest whales, the ocean supports a complex web of life. Coral reefs, often referred to as the rainforests of the sea, are particularly rich in biodiversity, providing a habitat for countless species.\n","\n","However, the ocean is facing numerous challenges. Pollution, overfishing, and climate change are threatening its delicate balance. Plastic waste, oil spills, and excessive carbon dioxide emissions are causing harm to marine ecosystems and endangering many species.\n","\n","Understanding and protecting the ocean is crucial for the well-being of our planet. It is a source of inspiration, resources, and sustenance for humanity. By promoting sustainable practices, conserving marine habitats, and raising awareness, we can ensure the ocean continues to thrive for generations to come.\n","\n","So, dive into the depths of knowledge about the ocean, explore its wonders, and join the efforts to preserve this magnificent and vital part of our world.\n"]}],"source":["# Few-Shot Prompting\n","messages=[\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"system\",\n","      \"content\": \"Answer in a consistent style.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"user\",\n","      \"content\": \"Teach me about patience.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n","      \"content\": \"The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; \\\n","      the grandest symphony originates from a single note; \\\n","      the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"user\",\n","      \"content\": \"Teach me about the ocean.\"\n","    }\n","]\n","\n","response = get_completion(messages)\n","\n","if response.choices:\n","    print(response.choices[0].message[\"content\"])\n","else:\n","    print(\"No response received.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Step 1: Start with the number of oranges you picked from your garden, which is 12.\n","Step 2: Subtract the number of oranges you gave to your friend, which is 3.
