It covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, holding an abundance of life and secrets beneath its depths. Let me take you on a journey to explore the wonders of the ocean.\n","\n","The ocean is a vast body of saltwater that stretches across the globe, connecting continents and shaping the climate. It is home to a diverse array of ecosystems, from coral reefs teeming with colorful fish to deep-sea trenches where bizarre and fascinating creatures dwell.\n","\n","One of the most remarkable features of the ocean is its sheer size. It is divided into five major basins: the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern, and Arctic Oceans. These vast expanses of water are interconnected, creating a complex system of currents that circulate heat, nutrients, and marine life around the planet.\n","\n","The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. It absorbs and stores vast amounts of heat from the sun, helping to moderate temperatures on land. It also acts as a massive carbon sink, absorbing a significant portion of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. However, human activities, such as pollution and overfishing, are putting immense pressure on the delicate balance of the ocean's ecosystems.\n","\n","The ocean is not only essential for the planet's health but also for human well-being. It provides a source of food, livelihoods, and recreational activities for millions of people worldwide. It is a place of beauty and tranquility, where the rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the shore can bring a sense of peace and serenity.\n","\n","Exploring the ocean's depths has always captivated human curiosity. From ancient seafarers navigating by the stars to modern-day submarines and deep-sea exploration vessels, humans have sought to uncover the secrets hidden beneath the surface. The ocean holds countless mysteries, with vast areas yet to be explored and species yet to be discovered.\n","\n","However, it is crucial to approach the ocean with respect and care. As stewards of the Earth, we must strive to protect its delicate ecosystems and preserve its biodiversity. By reducing pollution, practicing sustainable fishing, and promoting conservation efforts, we can ensure that future generations can continue to marvel at the wonders of the ocean.\n","\n","In conclusion, the ocean is a magnificent and awe-inspiring realm that holds a wealth of beauty, life, and untold stories. It is a reminder of the vastness and interconnectedness of our planet and the importance of preserving and respecting the\n"]}],"source":["# Few-Shot Prompting\n","messages=[\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"system\",\n","      \"content\": \"Answer in a consistent style.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"user\",\n","      \"content\": \"Teach me about patience.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n","      \"content\": \"The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; \\\n","      the grandest symphony originates from a single note; \\\n","      the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"role\": \"user\",\n","      \"content\": \"Teach me about the ocean.\"\n","    }\n","]\n","\n","response = get_completion(messages)\n","\n","if response.choices:\n","    print(response.choices[0].message[\"content\"])\n","else:\n","    print(\"No response received.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Step 1: Start with the number of oranges you picked from your garden, which is 12.\n","Step 2: Subtract the number of oranges you gave to your friend, which is 3.
